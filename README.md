## 🛠 Technical info
##### This section contains boring words, skip if not interested.
**TODO:**
"So, python is a realy great tool for creating launchers! Python's standart library is realy amazing, but there are some nuances for end users. First of all python is an interpreted language, it requires [runtime](https://www.python.org/downloads/). You absolutely can't use this cool launcher without python installation. Next, python's programs usually consist of some ".py" files. I prefer compress all of these files in one ".pyz" archive. ..."
